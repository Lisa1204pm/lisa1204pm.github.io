        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I graduated from University of Transportation in Korea in 2012 with a degree in computer science. My professional experience includes working as a junior Java web developer for 2 years, maintaining the intranet at the Korean Ministry of Strategy and Finance. I used Oracle, Java, and the Spring Framework extensively in this role, which allowed me to gain deep knowledge of these technologies and build upon my database design and management skills.</p>

        <p>I will be graduating from the SSD program in May 2023 and I have focused on using dynamic programming languages such as JavaScript and its frameworks to efficiently manipulate HTML, CSS, and data. I have also developed well-structured object-oriented programs using C#, and data-driven applications with C# and ASP.NET. Additionally, I have experience developing secure websites that manage user profiles, data, and resources in a safe manner for site users and owners, as well as developing mobile applications using cross-platform compatible frameworks.</p>
